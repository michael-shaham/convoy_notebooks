# Mixed Integer Programming for Path Planning

The Jupyter notebooks in this folder use MIP to plan trajectories for a single 
vehicle or multiple vehicles. ~~The planning problems should be able to be sped 
up by giving a better initialization to the optimization methods.~~ This was 
actually not the case, I'm guessing the optimization solvers are smart.
