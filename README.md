# Convoy notebooks

Jupyter notebooks and maybe some modules to prototype various perception, 
planning, and control algorithms for convoys.

Please don't judge based on this code, it's mostly for quick prototyping 
and making sure things work, but was also used to run simulations for 
the paper titled "Design and realization of a benchmarking testbed for 
evaluating autonomous platooning algorithms" which was accepted to ISER 
2023. The paper can be found 
[here](https://michael-shaham.github.io/papers/platoon_testbed.html).
